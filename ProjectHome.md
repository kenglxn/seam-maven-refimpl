[Know IT Objectnet](http://www.knowit.no/) developers have created a Mavenized Seam project template. Due to the lack of Maven support in the Seam project, we felt the need to get a project started for the topic. After some research and development, the base was ready to be put in use. We felt that it was only right to make the project available to the public, and put together a google code project.
As of now the project is aimed at running on the JBoss-4.2.3 and JBoss-5.x application servers deployed as an EAR project.

We welcome fellow Seam + Maven fans to this project. Whether you want to use this template to develop your own projects, or you want to contribute to the project, we invite you to check out the code.
