Here are the steps required to get the project up and running.
  * [http://www.glxn.net/seam-maven-refimpl/doc/tutorial/  The Getting Started tutorial explains the basic steps].
  * [http://seam-maven-refimpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples Export the examples "root" POM from the samples folder and install it to your local .m2 repo]. 
    * Open a command shell and cd to the folder where you exported the pom, e.g ./seam-refimpl/samples/.	
    * Execute *mvn install* to install the pom.
    * This is the "root" POM for all the example applications, so you need to install it to your local m2 repo.

    * Execute ./samples/seaminaction/etc/schema/open18-schema-mysql-ch04.sql
