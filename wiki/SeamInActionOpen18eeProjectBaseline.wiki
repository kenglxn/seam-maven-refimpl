#summary A Mavenized Version of Seam In Action, Chapter Two.

= A Mavenized Version of Seam In Action, Chapter Two. =

We have made a Mavenized version of the source code from chapter two in the excellent Seam In Action book using the *seam-refimpl* as a project template. For those who prefers Maven as a build management system this should be a suitable starting point to play with the example code while reading the book. 
You will need JBoss-4.2.3 or JBoss-5.x and MYSQL-5.x to run the project "as is".

== Howto ==
Here are the steps required to get the project up and running.
  * [http://www.glxn.net/seam-maven-refimpl/doc/tutorial/  The Getting Started tutorial explains the basic steps]
  * [http://seam-maven-refimpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples Export the samples POM from svn and install it] (mvn install). This is the "root" POM for all example applications and you need to install to your local m2 repo.	
    * Open a command shell and cd to the folder where you exported the pom, e.g ./seam-refimpl/samples/.	
    * Execute *mvn install* to install the pom.
  * In MYSQL
    * Create database "*open18initial_db*"
    * Execute ./samples/seaminaction/etc/schema/open18-initial-schema-mysql.sql
    * Execute ./samples/seaminaction/etc/schema/open18-initial-seed-data-mysql.sql
  * [http://seam-maven-refimpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/seaminaction/stages/projects-baseline/open18ee Export project from svn]
    * Copy open18ee/config/profiles.xml to open18ee. Modify profiles.xml as explained in the getting started tutorial.
    * Open a command shell and cd to project folder, open18ee 
    * Execute *mvn install -Pexplode*
  * Start the server and access the application at [http://localhost:8080/open18-baseline]
