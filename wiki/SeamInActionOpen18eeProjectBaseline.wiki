#summary A Mavenized Version of Seam In Action, Chapter Two.

= A Mavenized Version of Seam In Action, Chapter Two. =

We have made a Mavenized version of the source code from chapter two in the excellent Seam In Action book using the *seam-refimpl* as a project template. For those who prefers Maven as a build management system this should be a suitable starting point to play with the example code while reading the book. 

== Howto ==
Here are the steps needed to get the project up and running.
  * The project requires JBoss-4.2.3 or JBoss-5.x and MYSQL-5.x to run.
  * [http://www.glxn.net/seam-maven-refimpl/doc/tutorial/  The Getting Started tutorial explains the basic steps]
  * [http://seam-maven-refimpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/seaminaction/stages/projects-baseline/open18ee Export project from svn]
  * In MYSQL, create database "*open18initial_db*"
  * Execute open18ee/config/schema/open18-initial-schema-mysql.sql
  * execute open18ee/config/schema/open18-initial-seed-data-mysql.sql
  * Copy open18ee/config/profiles.xml to open18ee. Modify profiles.xml as needed.
  * Execute *mvn install -Pexplode*
  * You're ready to go!
