#summary A Mavenized version of the JBoss Seam 2.1.2 groovybooking WEB example

= A Mavenized Version of jboss-seam-2.1.2/examples/groovybooking WEB example =

This is a Mavenized Version of the jboss-seam-2.1.2/examples/groovybooking WEB example project. The example application is tested on JBoss Application Server 4.2.3 GA jdk6.

== Differences from the original application ==
  * The datasource file, `seam-groovybooking-web-ds.xml`, is moved to the project root folder
  * Uses standard Maven directory layout
  * Groovy files are located in the `war/src/groovy` directory
  * Removed `components.properties`, uses filtering to set values in `components.xml`
  * installed="false" did not work for `persistence:entity-manager-factory`, installed must evaluate to "true" for jboss-4.2.3.GA-jdk6
{{{
    <persistence:entity-manager-factory 
      name="groovyEntityManagerFactory"
      persistence-unit-name="groovy" 
      installed="true"/>
}}}
  * No hot code replacement, all compiled code deployed to `WEB-INF/classes`
  * Fixed transient dependencies
  * Used gmaven-plugin to compile Groovy files
  * "groovy-all" must be upgraded to version 1.6.3. Version 1.5.4 provided by the Seam-2.1.2 root POM, does not work.
