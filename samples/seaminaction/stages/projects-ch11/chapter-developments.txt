Seam in Action: Chapter 11
--------------------------
This file details developments made to the application source code during this
chapter. Please note that the enhancements described here my go beyond what is
covered in the book.

TODO:
  - backport fix for preserving course search in conversation

open18:
  - add @Name("golfer") and @Role(name = "currentGolfer", scope = ScopeType.SESSION) to the Golfer entity
  - changed all checks for currentGolfer to s:hasRole('golfer')
  - added encoding and saltPhrase to PasswordManager
  - prepares for Identity Management in Seam 2.1, which uses base64 rather than hex and allows for the use of a salt

Modifications to original code:
-------------------------------
Created two source trees in ejb module using the Build Helper Maven Plugin,
http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/. 
The plugin allows you to add additional source directories to your module.

The original source code does not follow the default Maven convention. By default with maven you can 
only specify a single source directory, but the Seam In Action code is split into several source 
trees. Mavenizing the code can be done i two ways: either by splitting the source code into  
separate (ejb) modules (as I have done in the previous chapters, ch03-ch06) or by using the Build 
Helper Maven Plugin to maintain more than one source tree within the same (ejb) module. Although the 
latter might be considered as bad practice, in some situations it can be convinient to add an extra 
source path to the build. 

Blogs explaining how to use the Build Helper Maven Plugin can be found here:
