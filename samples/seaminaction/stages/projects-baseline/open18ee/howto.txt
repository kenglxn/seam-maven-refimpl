= A Mavenized Version of Seam In Action, Chapter Two. =

We have made a Mavenized version of the source code from chapter two in the excellent Seam In Action book using the *seam-refimpl* as a project template. For those who prefers Maven as a build management system this should be a suitable starting point to play with the example code while reading the book. 
You will need JBoss-4.2.3 or JBoss-5.x and MYSQL-5.x to run the project "as is".
