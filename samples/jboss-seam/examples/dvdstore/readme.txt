This is a premature project example.
Will try to finish late august.

Packaged ear deploy works on JBAS-5.1 - exploded ear does not work yet

DO:
* copy env-prod.properties to env-dev.properties 
  and modify as described in the Getting Started tutorial
* run mvn clean install
* copy jboss-seam-dvdstore.ear to server deploy folder
* browse http://localhost:8080/seam-dvdstore/home
