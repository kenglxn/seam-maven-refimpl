= A Mavenized JEE version of the JBoss Seam 2.2.0 groovybooking example =

This is a Mavenized JEE version of the JBoss Seam 2.2.0 groovybooking examle. The example application is tested on JBoss Application Server 4.2.3 GA jdk6 and 5.1.0 GA jdk6

Mavenizing a Seam Groovy application was not an easy task, i had to do a lot of experimenting to get Groovy to play nice in a Seam Maven environment. The groovy-all jar dependency, version 1.5.4, provided by the seam-2.2.0 root POM did not work; I had to upgrade the dependency to version 1.7. The gmaven-plugin is preconfigured in the refimpl root pom: 
{{{
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.groovy.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>gmaven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <debug>true</debug>
    <stacktrace>true</stacktrace>
    <targetBytecode>1.5</targetBytecode> <!-- is the value to compile for a JDK 1.5 or later JVM. -->
    <verbose>true</verbose>
    <sourceEncoding>utf-8</sourceEncoding>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>generateStubs</goal>
        <goal>compile</goal>
        <goal>generateTestStubs</goal>
        <goal>testCompile</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>   
}}}

Differences from the original app:
==================================
  * Uses standard Maven directory layout
  * `*`.java moved to ejb/src/main/java folder
  * `*`.groovy files moved to ejb/src/main/groovy folder
  * Removed components.properties, uses filtering to set values in components.xml
  * Uses gmaven-plugin to compile Groovy files
  * "groovy-all" is upgraded to version 1.7.1 in the refimpl root POM. Version 1.5.4 provided by the seam-2.2.0 root POM, does not work.

== How to install and run the application ==
  * [http://www.glxn.net/seam-maven-refimpl/doc/tutorial/ The Getting Started tutorial explains the basic steps]
