= A Mavenized JEE version of the JBoss Seam 2.1.2 groovybooking example =

This is a Mavenized JEE version of the JBoss Seam 2.1.2 groovybooking examle.
The example application is tested on JBoss Application Server 4.2.3 GA jdk6

Differences from the original app:
==================================
  * Uses standard Maven directory layout
  * `*`.java moved to ejb/src/main/java folder
  * `*`.groovy files moved to ejb/src/main/groovy folder
  * Removed components.properties, uses filtering to set values in components.xml
  * Uses gmaven-plugin to compile Groovy files
  * "groovy-all" must be upgraded to version 1.6.3. Version 1.5.4 provided by the Seam-2.1.2 root POM, does not work.

== How to install and run the application: ==
  * [http://www.glxn.net/seam-maven-refimpl/doc/tutorial/ The Getting Started tutorial explains the basic steps]
  * [http://seam-maven-refimpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples Export the samples POM from svn].
  * Open a command shell and cd to the folder where you exported the pom, e.g ./seam-refimpl/samples/.
  * Execute *mvn install* to install the pom. This is the "root" POM for all example applications and you need to install it to your local m2 repo.
  * CD to ./samples/jboss-seam/examples/groovybooking-jee
  * Copy config/profiles.xml to the project root folder, groovybooking-jee. Modify profiles.xml as needed.
  * Execute *mvn install -Pexplode*
  * Access the application at http://localhost:8080/seam-groovybooking-jee
  * Also read the *readme.txt* from the original JBoss Seam example
