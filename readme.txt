Before you build any projects you'll have to build the root pom and the seam-refimpl project.

* Open a console an CD to the trunk folder, e.g. ./seam-maven-refimpl/trunk.

* Type: mvn clean install
  The maven install command builds the no.knowit.seam root pom which all projects in this trunk
  uses as its root pom.
