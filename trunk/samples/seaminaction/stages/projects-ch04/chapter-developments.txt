Seam in Action: Chapter 04
--------------------------
This file details developments made to the application source code during this
chapter. Please note that the enhancements described here my go beyond what is
covered in the book.

NOTE: Not all of the features will be migrated from chapter to chapter. If I
feel that I feature was just for demonstration purposes and not all that useful
for the application itself, I don't migrate it. Thus, don't be suprised if
chapter 4 doesn't have all of the code added in chapter 3.

open18-db:

  - updated using top-down development with MEMBER and GOLFER tables
  - if you want to make the changes to the schema before running the application, execute the following command from the example code root directory:

java -cp lib/h2.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:file:databases/open18-db/h2 -user open18 -password tiger -script etc/schema/open18-incremental-chaper04.sql

open18:

  - hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto changed from validate to update to support top-down development 
  - added Member and Golfer entities; Golfer extends from Member using joined inheritence (see JPA documentation)
  - added Gender enum
  - added RegisterAction, which serves as action handler for register screen
  - added register.xhtml page for signing up a new golfer into the system
  - added PasswordBean for capturing password and PasswordManager for validating password entry and encrypting password
  - added RegisterActionTest to serve as unit test for RegisterAction component
  - added RegisterGolferIntegerationTest for doing in-container testing of registration logic; currently test must be run with Java 5
  - added note on login page that the authentication is not hooked up to member registration 
  - the seam-gen command was used twice in this chapter, with the following responses

./seam new-entity

entity class name: Golfer
master page name: GolferList
detail page name: Golfer
